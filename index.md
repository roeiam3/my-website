# Welcome

Currently deep-diving into the next layer of networking. If it involves packets, protocols, or complex topologies, I'm on it. Always learning, always labbing.

## About Me

I specialize in network engineering with a focus on understanding how data moves across complex infrastructures. My work involves designing, troubleshooting, and optimizing network systems.

When I'm not configuring routers or analyzing packet captures, I'm building my homelab and exploring new networking technologies.
