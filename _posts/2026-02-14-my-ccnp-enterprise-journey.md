So, you want to tackle the CCNP Enterprise.

When I decided to jump into this, I wanted a certification that was generalized enough to cover the broad landscape of networking but deep enough to actually matter. The combination of ENCOR (350-401) and ENARSI (300-410) provides exactly that.

But there is a massive difference between what the syllabus says and what the exam floor actually feels like.

## The Strategy: Breadth vs. Depth

The CCNP is a game of two halves:

- **The ENCOR (The Wide and Shallow):** Since this is a prerequisite for both the CCNP and the CCIE, you cannot skip it. It familiarizes you with topics you might not touch daily, like Automation, SD-WAN, and Wireless. It is a mile wide and an inch deep.
- **The ENARSI (The Deep and Sparse):** This is where you pick your line of interest. Unlike the ENCOR, concentration exams force you to move from remembering to understanding.

**My opinion:** Even if you are aiming for the CCIE, do not skip the ENARSI. It forces you to learn the big four (BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, and MPLS) at deeper levels and gets you used to the specific way Cisco asks questions.
This is true for taking any concentration 

## "The Blueprint Is a Lie"

Why am I calling it a lie? Because Cisco is notoriously frustrating when it comes to exam depth.

While the topics on the blueprint do show up, the document is incredibly misleading about how much you need to know. The ENARSI is the biggest offender here. If you only learn how to configure basic MPLS or skim through DMVPN, you will lose points.

Cisco will hit you with questions on obscure, niche features that technically fall under the category but were never explicitly emphasized in the study guides. They can mislead you into believing a shallower depth than what is actually required to pass.

## My 2026 Toolkit

My study stack below reflects what actually moved the needle.

| Resource | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Network Lessons (Rene Molenaar)** | Great for learning quickly, especially when a topic feels dense. |
| **Official Cert Guide (OCG)** | Mandatory foundation, but not enough depth alone for exam-day edge cases. |
| **Boson Practice Exams** | Essential for simulation and pacing, though lab quality can vary. |
| **Cisco White Papers** | Non-negotiable for ENARSI. Critical for the kind of niche questions Cisco asks. |

**The verdict:** You can pass ENCOR without digging through white papers, but for ENARSI they are integral. To be the best, you have to dig through the documentation.

## Advice for the Next Candidate

If I could sit down with anyone starting this journey today, I would tell them this:

The exam is a marathon, not a race. It is not won by short bursts of lab crunching followed by weeks of emptiness. It is won by slow, methodical, paced studying.

- Read every topic.
- Understand every tiny detail.
- Lab every single possible command and feature.
- Never say, "That probably will not appear." In a Cisco exam, it absolutely will.

## ENCOR Study Notes (PDF)

I put together a personal ENCOR PDF while studying. It is not perfect, but it can still be useful if you are preparing for the exam.

It covers almost all ENCOR-relevant topics, and writing everything down helped me internalize and memorize the material much more effectively.
