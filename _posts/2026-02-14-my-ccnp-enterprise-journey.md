## Why I Started

I started the CCNP Enterprise track to strengthen my ability to design and troubleshoot production-grade networks with confidence and speed.

## Study Strategy

My plan is built around short feedback loops:

1. Learn a concept.
2. Recreate it in a lab.
3. Break it on purpose.
4. Troubleshoot until root cause is clear.
5. Document findings and repeat.

This process helps convert memorized material into practical operational skill.

## Core Resources

- Cisco official exam topics and documentation
- Video-based refreshers for weak topics
- Repeated lab simulations for routing and switching behavior
- Personal notes with clear failure patterns and fixes

## Biggest Challenge So Far

The hardest part has been balancing depth and speed. It is easy to consume material quickly but harder to retain under pressure. Lab repetition has been the best way to improve retention and confidence.

## What Comes Next

Upcoming posts will include focused breakdowns of specific topics, troubleshooting playbooks, and lesson summaries from real lab sessions.
